					<p>On November 22, 1963, three shots rang out in Dallas, President Kennedy died, and the world changed. What if you could change it back? Stephen King's heart-stoppingly dramatic new novel is about a man who travels back in time to prevent the JFK assassination&#8212a thousand page tour de force.</p>
					<p>Following his massively successful novel <em>Under the Dome,</em> King sweeps readers back in time to another moment&#8212a real life moment&#8212when everything went wrong: the JFK assassination. And he introduces readers to a character who has the power to change the course of history.</p>
					<p>Jake Epping is a thirty-five-year-old high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching adults in the GED program. He receives an essay from one of the students&#8212a gruesome, harrowing first person story about the night 50 years ago when Harry Dunning's father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk.</p>
