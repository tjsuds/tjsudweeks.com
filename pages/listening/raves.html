					<p>It's that time again, I know. I pretty much have to do my first December rave about my favorite christmas album of all-time, Sufjan Steven's <em>Songs for Christmas</em>. (tied with Amy Grant, of course)</p>
					<p>This compilation may just be the best tribute to Christmas by any artist I know. You can tell that Sufjan spent a lot of effort putting this album together (over several years) with traditional songs as well as his own infusions&#8212which are excellent by the way. <em>We're Going to the Country!</em>, <em>Sister Winter</em> and <em>That Was the Worst Christmas Ever!</em> are great starting points on the new stuff. The mix of traditional and new is just right.</p>
					<p>One thing to keep in mind is that this is a MASSIVE compilation with five separate albums/discs. Be thankful for modern-day iPhones and mp3 players because I could never decide which album I liked best when I first got this back in 2006 and I was constantly returning to my cd boom box to swap discs. Then I got an iPod video, hurrah!</p>
					<p><em>Songs for Christmas</em> is a timeless tribute to the holiday season that has since been a staple each year for my family. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!</p>

					</a>
					<p>Five minutes into the album I was shaking my head and wondering, 'how did it take me this long to hear this!?' After that moment I had <em>Camp</em> on repeat for a solid two weeks.</p>
					<p>I tend to gravitate towards smart/indie crossover rap&#8212if that description even makes any sense&#8212and this album hit that vein perfectly. I found really refreshing to hear Donald Glover (aka Childish Gambino) cater to the surging african american middle class, basically saying, 'who cares if you're not a gangster or grew up in Compton. And does that even matter?'</p>
					<p>I also found that I could relate to a lot of Glover's material, growing up in the same era and seemingly were drawn to many of the same influences. For instance in <em>Firefly</em> when he says he was 'the only black kid at a Sufjan Concert' and in <em>L.E.S.</em> admitting he loves the Nikelodeon cartoon Rugrats. These are just a couple of the many golden nuggets in this album that left me smiling.</p>
					<p>Please don't make the same mistake that I did and overlook this album and Childish Gambino's other material. Seriously, don't wait!</p>

					</a>
					<p>Tame Impala's new album <em>Currents</em> is exactly the kind of genius album that few bands create now-a-days. It fights directly against modern-day streaming's lack of incentive for artists to create a comprehensive album. It's an experience meant to be experienced in its fullness&#8212not on a one-off basis. Every song in <em>Currents</em> is thematically important and is built and molded to be consumed together. If you're skimming this album for a killer intro song on your new playlist, look elsewhere.</p>
					<p>Returning Tame Impala fans will find that <em>Currents</em> is much different from <em>Lonerism</em> and <em>InnerSpeaker</em>. As cliche as it is to say that a band's third album is 'more mature' and 'grown up'&#8212it is. And it's amazing. It's lyrically compelling and personal and the instrumentals are more controlled, yet more psychedelic than ever before. You find yourself sinking deeper and deeper into its complexities after each listen. Seriously though, this album would fit right in with the late-night laser shows playing <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> or Led Zeppelin.</p>
					<p>Aside from the sounds and feelings of this album, I became even more enthralled with Tame Impala's mastermind Kevin Parker. After my first listen I almost obsessively sought out additional content and 'behind the scenes' information. I learned that Parker's writing and creating style is much the same as my own. The mindset is obsessive&#8212and has to be to get it right. When asked about what music influenced and inspired his writing in <em>Currents</em> he said:</p>
					<p>"It sounds like a cop-out, but I honestly couldn't name anything that directly influenced me, because I don't really listen to a lot of music these days, intentionally. I'm so consumed by making music myself that I just prefer to be thinking about new music that I make all the time. Especially when I'm in the writing and recording process, the idea of music in the outside world is a distraction almost."</p>
