					<p><em>Jimla. Jimla. Jimla.</em> This word and phrases like &#39the past is obdurate&#39 may just stay with me forever.</p>
					<p>My journey with this book was a long one. I casually loaded it onto my kindle in preparation for a long flight back in November 2011 when it was released. I read through the first few chapters with little engagement and prematurely judged the concept as just another cliche time travel story. Just shy of four years later my rebounded curiosity in the JFK shooting gave me just enough interest to give it another shot. <strong>And I'm so glad that I did.</strong></p>
					<p>Leave it up to Stephen King to take a stale concept and make it great again. King doesn't hesitate to incorporate the dark and creepy moments that I covertly crave. I seriously love the interactions the main character, Jake Epping (aka George Amberson) has with the &#39rabbit hole&#39 bouncers and his unpredicable and cringeworthy fight will the obdurate past. (I'll be honest, I actually had to Google &#39obdurate&#39 for the definition. So don't hesitate.)</p>
					<p>You may just find yourself slowly being immersed in the &#39Land of Ago&#39 while you follow the protagonist through its countless pros and cons. It's especially fun for a millennial like myself to realize just how much American life really has changed in 50 years. For example, I literally salivated at the description of old-school Root Beer.</p>
					<p>It's also obvious that King spent loads of time researching just about every angle of the shooting. Not just sorting through the countless conspiracy theories but actually trying to get down to the bottom of who the shooter was and all the people who influenced him along the way.</p>
					<p>I did, however, have moments where I wanted to scream, &#34Get on with the JFK gig, man!&#34 But I ended up appreciating the expedition when both meaningful and seemingly insignificant events early on in the narrative actually carried significant weight in the JFK-filled grand finale. If you're like me and can't bring yourself to skim when reading books, its better to tackle this one with the expectation of reading three or four interrelated stories rather than expecting the focus to strictly be on JFK.</p>
					<p>In the end, I confidently recommend 11/22/63 and wouldn't hesitate to go down the &#39rabbit hole&#39 just to finish it four years earlier.</p>

					<a href="http://www.amazon.com/11-22-63-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B004Q7CIFI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=" target='_blank'><img src="../../../resources/images/misc/amazon.png"></a>
					<p>On November 22, 1963, three shots rang out in Dallas, President Kennedy died, and the world changed. What if you could change it back? Stephen King's heart-stoppingly dramatic new novel is about a man who travels back in time to prevent the JFK assassination&#8212a thousand page tour de force.</p>
					<p>Following his massively successful novel <em>Under the Dome,</em> King sweeps readers back in time to another moment&#8212a real life moment&#8212when everything went wrong: the JFK assassination. And he introduces readers to a character who has the power to change the course of history.</p>
					<p>Jake Epping is a thirty-five-year-old high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching adults in the GED program. He receives an essay from one of the students&#8212a gruesome, harrowing first person story about the night 50 years ago when Harry Dunning's father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk.</p>
					<p>Not much later, Jake's friend Al, who runs the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to 1958. He enlists Jake on an insane&#8212and insanely possible&#8212mission to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins Jake's new life as George Amberson and his new world of Elvis and JFK, of big American cars and sock hops, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of Jake's life &#8211 a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time.</p>
					<p>A tribute to a simpler era and a devastating exercise in escalating suspense, 11/22/63 is Stephen King at his epic best.</p>
