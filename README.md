My noob attempt at code.

I have been teaching myself the basics of html and css during the past few weeks. I quickly learned that I needed to work on a project in parallel in order to retain what I was learning. I also known next to nothing about Git and GitHub up to this point, so this is my Git Guinea Pig.

Once the v.1 is built out I will make it live @ tjsudweeks.com
